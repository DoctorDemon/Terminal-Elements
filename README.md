Terminal-Elements is a modern JavaScript library that introduces custom web components for creating styled terminal-like UI elements, headings, paragraphs, tables, and alerts. Designed with encapsulated styling via Shadow DOM, this library helps developers build polished and responsive web components with ease.



## Features

- **`<terminal-output>`**: Displays styled terminal-like content with syntax highlighting for the standard Unix `user@hostname` in green.
- **`<heading-text>`**: Customizable heading elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) with a clean and modern design.
- **`<paragraph-text>`**: Elegant paragraph elements for displaying text with a professional look.
- **`<styled-table>`**: Tables with modern styling, responsive behavior, and clean borders.
- **`<styled-alert>`**: Alerts for critical, warning, or informational messages with three customizable types.


## Installation
Download the `terminal-elements.js` and add it to your project directory. Wherever you want to use the custom tags, the script must be included. You can import it using the `<script>` tag in the `<head>` of your HTML file.

### Using `<script>` tag:

Include the JavaScript file in your HTML:

```html
<script src="path/to/terminal-elements.js"></script>
```

### Features to Implement
- [ ] Rename the tags to cleaner versions (eg. \<terminal-output\> to \<terminal\>.
- [ ] Add support for customizable themes for all components.
- [ ] Implement additional terminal styles for `<terminal-output>`.
- [ ] Add support for prism.js to handle better colorization.

### Documentation Improvements
